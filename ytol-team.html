				<h2 class="top-title">A Letter From</h2>
				<h3 class="sub-title">YOUR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBLE</h3>
				<div id=LetterBody>
					Hello YTOLers and friends & family of YTOL!
					<p>  It's with great honor and humility that I introduce myself to you as your new International Responsible and accept this great invitation of service. The Youth Teams of Our Lady movement has been a tremendous Blessing in my life. I attended my first base team meeting nearly seven years ago and my first IM just over five years ago in Rome. I served on the USA National Secretariat for five years, and was the National Responsible for four years. I am from Turlock, California which is where YTOL in the USA began. As soon as I became involved with YTOL, I knew that this movement would forever change my life, and it truly has. Through YTOL, I’ve been given the opportunity to fall deeper in love with Christ, to discover a family within my team, and of course, develop beautiful friendships with people from throughout the world.</p>
					<p>  I’ve had the opportunity to meet many of you at the IM in Roma (2009), the IM in California (2012), and of course, at the most recent IM in Portugal! What a beautiful time we all shared together. During the IM week, we reflected on the path of St. Peter, (Domine, Quo Vadis?) We, as a movement, must have the courage to approach Jesus and let Him change our lives. When we do this, we will not only strengthen our own faith, but also draw others closer to Christ. </p>
					<p>  As it is written in the Psalms, ("Sing to the LORD, bless his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. / Tell his glory among the nations; among all peoples, his marvelous deeds." Psalm 96:2-3) we are all called to lift up the Lord and praise Him for His works; we should pray to be so filled with love for Him and the blessings of the Spirit that we cannot keep silent. As YTOLers, I believe we have a very special role; which is to share with our peers the love that God has shown us. Our love for Him, Our Blessed Mother, Our Church, and the International YTOL Movement; can change the world. I especially want to mention this with our brothers and sisters Syria in mind and heart - we as a movement should constantly be striving to unite in prayer for them and be steadfast in our intentions for peace throughout the world.</p>
					<p>  Please know that I will offer you, as well all of the YTOL members throughout the world, to our Blessed Mother everyday; that she would wrap you in her mantle, and lead you closer to her Son, our Lord, Jesus Christ. I promise to serve you in every way that I can; relying solely upon the help of the Lord to strengthen this movement to grow and flourish throughout the world. It was said by Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta, “Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love.” The duty of YTOL International Responsible although challenging, is also simple, because it is one of love, compassion, and service – that’s my heart's promise to you!</p>
					<p>  I want to thank the teams in the USA for all of their support as we take on this responsibility for the first time in YTOL history. Additionally, we can't thank Pedro Evanil and the rest of the 2012-2014 International Secretariat (Brazil) enough for their amazing leadership these past two years. I also want to thank the IM 2014 Organizing Team in Portugal for planning such an outstanding meeting. God will truly Bless you all for all of your efforts and prayers to further His kingdom. Thank you!</p>
					<p>  God has indeed Blessed me with the gift of YTOL, and all of the friends (which are more like family!) that I have gained through this journey. It is a small humble gesture to take this responsibility on in a humble attempt to thank Him for all He has given me. I ask that you would all pray for me as I take on this role; that God would grant me and the new International Secretariat the strength and knowledge necessary to discern the vision of YTOL International in order to bring the love of Christ to more young people throughout the world! Please pray for our team as we prepare for an incredible two years of supporting nearly 4,000 YTOLers - thank you for praying for us as we pray for you!</p>
					<p>  Feel free to reach out to me at anytime via email, or add me on Facebook – I’d love to hear from you and pray for any intentions you have!</p>
					<p>  I thank God for this amazing opportunity! I am so overjoyed to be your new International Responsible! Many blessings & prayers from the USA!</p>
