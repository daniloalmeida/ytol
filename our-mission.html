				<h3 class="sub-title">To Seek HOLINESS</h3>
				
				<div id="ytol-history">
					<p>The <strong>YTOL Movement</strong> forms within the Church a worldwide spiritual community, aiming at human and spiritual formation of their members within a team. The Team, a true ecclesial community, constitutes then the basic cell of the Movement.</p>
					<p>Thus, the mission of the YTOL is to help the youth who are called to holiness to discover and put into practice all the dimensions of the Christian spirituality, in fidelity to the teachings of the Catholic Church, having Mary’s “yes” as a model. The YTOL help their members to progress in the love of God and in the love of their neighbor: they have recourse to brotherly mutual help so that the members can adopt concrete conditions of their personal, family, professional and social lives according to the will of God; they encourage the members to become conscious of their evangelizing mission in the Church and in the world, by means of the witness and of such other activities as they may decide to engage in.</p>
					<p>It is not realistic to claim to help one’s friends to lead a spiritual life, if one does not first help them to overcome their worries and difficulties. This is why the youth of the YTOL practice mutual help generously, as much materially as spiritually, obeying Saint Paul’s great precept: <em><strong>“Bear one another’s burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ” (Gal 6: 2)</strong></em>.</p>
					<p>The <strong>Acts of the Apostles (4, 32)</strong> tell us that the early Christians “were of one heart and one soul”. Seeing them, the pagans were surprised: “See, how they love one another!” The YTOL think that, today as then, non-believers will be won over to Christ if they see Christian youth truly loving one another and helping one another in seeking God and in serving their brothers and sisters. And so, brotherly love, going beyond mutual help, becomes a witness.</p>
					<p>In pursuing for holiness, the <strong>YTOL members privilege</strong> the following means:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Formal meeting with appropriate time for prayer, theme reflection, sharing of experience about quotidian and spiritual life and definition of a “rule of life” (point of effort);</li>
						<li>Formation sessions at regional, national and international levels: gatherings, conferences, retreats, living together, community prayers;</li>
						<li>Individual apostolic and social activities, especially in the field of evangelization within the family, the society and the Church.</li>
					</ul>
