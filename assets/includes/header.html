<meta name="description" content="YTOL - Youth Teams of Our Lady. The formation of youth teams was an idea that couples responsible for the Teams of Our Lady (TOL), World Movement of Catholic couples, had for some years. Already during the TOL International Meeting in Rome in 1970 it was intended to launch this project, but only in 1976 it was possible to accomplish it. And through out the years we've grown stronger, in belief that Our Lady Mary is watching every single one of us, doesn't matter where we are." />
