				<h3 class="sub-title">HISTORY OF THE YOUTH TEAMS OF OUR LADY</h3>
				
				<div id="ytol-history">
					<p>Formation of youth teams was an idea that couples responsible for the Teams of Our Lady (TOL), World Movement of Catholic couples, had for some years. Already during the TOL International Meeting in Rome in 1970 it was intended to launch this project, but only in 1976 it was possible to accomplish it.</p>
					<p><strong>1976, Paris (France)</strong> - It was the preparation for another International Meeting of the TOL couples. Christine d'Ammonville, daughter of French couple responsible for International TOL, Thierry Rosset and some others suggest and arrange a meeting for the young children of couples participating in the TOL encounter. They ask for this, collaboration of Father Guy Thomazeau.<br />These young people who regularly attended the meetings of parents since childhood, anxious to drinking from the same source of Christian spirituality, decided it was time to have a specific condition for development of their own religiosity, with more appropriate standards to the young singles.</p>
					<p><strong>1976/Sept, Rome (Italy)</strong> - In parallel to the event of the TOL couples, follows the meeting of young people from various countries realizing, thus, the project of creating an international Catholic youth movement, inspired on spirituality, dynamics and organization of the TOL.</p>
					<p><strong>1976/77, Paris (France)</strong> - Christine d'Ammonville is seen as idealistic and persistent. Many consider her project as a nice idea only, that time will dilute. Even facing such disrepute, with the help of Father Guy Thomazeau and the couple Jacqueline and Michel Perreau, Christine begins to prepare a 2nd Meeting, to be held next summer. On the other hand, almost spontaneously and without much organization, young people coming from Rome encounter begin to disseminate the rich experience they lived and form Teams in their countries. In the city of Porto (Portugal) Friar Bernardo Domingues, Spiritual Counselor of TOL couples, invites Carlos Grijó to organize these groups that are calling themselves "Youth Teams".</p>
					<p><strong>1977/Sept, Gap (France)</strong> - Around 100 young people between 18 and 24 years old from several European countries (France, Portugal, Belgium, Austria, Italy and Switzerland) attended the 2nd Meeting. It appears that the design of the Movement begins to bear fruits: the "Youth Teams of Our Lady" (YTOL) are now a reality and leave Gap strengthened and hopeful. Another meeting is scheduled for next year.</p>
					<p><strong>1978/Sept Lourdes (France)</strong> - The 3rd International Meeting of YTOL at this time still referred to as "the Movement Encounter," animates people and assigns responsibilities. Movement broadens across Europe and brings 160 participants from France, Portugal, Belgium, Austria and Switzerland. In France, where Teams are already working regularly in various regions, the Movement’s Animation Team is headquartered, holding the international liaison.</p>
					<p><strong>1979/Sept, Sarlat (France)</strong> - The 4th International Meeting of YTOL, involving about 200 youth. Representatives of each country are appointed (not called "responsible" yet) and the worldwide operation of the Movement’s Animation Team is defined. This, directed by Jean-Michel Vallat, writes the "Contrat - Equipes Notre Dame Jeunes", the first document officially describing the Movement.</p>
					<p><strong>1980/Aug, Batsurguère (France)</strong> - The 5th International Meeting brought together 250 participants from 9 countries (France, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Spain) including, for the first time representatives from the United States, England and Syria  (where there is no Teams yet). The meeting highlight was the celebration of an international Mass in the Sanctuary of Lourdes. The International organization structure is established: each Team must have a Responsible that should maintain contact with the local Sector; each country will have a National Responsible, or group of Regional Responsible, who will liaise with the Movement’s Animation Team; countries should organize activities and regional and national meetings; the International Meeting continues to be annual.</p>
					<p><strong>1981/Aug, Garaison (France)</strong> - 6th International Meeting of YTOL.</p>
					<p><strong>1982/Sept, Rome (Italy)</strong> - The 7th International Meeting occurs in parallel with the TOL couples. The two movements have a private audience with Pope John Paul II when he blesses the second "Contrat" in the presence of Jean-Michel Vallat, Claire de la Sayette (new Responsible of the Movement’s Animation Team), Madalena Fontoura, among others. Father Jean Marie Dubois replaces Fr. Guy Thomazeau as Spiritual Counselor of the Movement, internationally.

The highlight of this encounter is the pilgrimage to Fatima, when the devotion to Mary introduced by Portugal starts to define the YTOL Movement in a special way.
